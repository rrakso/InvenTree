Contributions to InvenTree are welcomed - please follow the guidelines below.

## Feature Branches

No pushing to master! New featues must be submitted in a separate branch (one branch per feature).

## Include Migration Files

Any required migration files **must** be included in the commit, or the pull-request will be rejected. If you change the underlying database schema, make sure you run `make migrate` and commit the migration files before submitting the PR.

## Update Translation Files

Any PRs which update translatable strings (i.e. text strings that will appear in the web-front UI) must also update the translation (locale) files to include hooks for the translated strings. 

*This does not mean that all translations must be provided, but that the translation files must include locations for the translated strings to be written.*

To perform this step, simply run `make_translate` from the top level directory before submitting the PR.

## Testing

Any new code should be covered by unit tests - a submitted PR may not be accepted if the code coverage is decreased.

## Documentation

New features or updates to existing features should be accompanied by user documentation.
A PR with associated documentation should link to the matching PR at https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree.github.io

## Code Style

Sumbitted Python code is automatically checked against PEP style guidelines. Locally you can run `make style` to ensure the style checks will pass, before submitting the PR.
